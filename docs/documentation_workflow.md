## Recommended Documentation Workflow: COML to Markdown

### Regular COML Updates
- Keep documentation primarily in **COML format** for structured and precise updates.
- Perform regular updates to COML documents, explicitly verifying document structure before and after edits.
- Ensure all edits are explicitly scoped and clearly bounded.

### Periodic Markdown Conversion
- Periodically convert COML documents to Markdown format:
  - For external sharing
  - For improved readability and general accessibility
  - For archival or reference purposes
- Always explicitly verify converted Markdown documents against the source COML documents to ensure:
  - Accurate formatting
  - No content loss or misinterpretation

### Benefits
- Structured maintenance of precise documentation (COML).
- Clear, readable, and broadly accessible format for sharing (Markdown).

Adopting this workflow ensures accurate, structured, and accessible documentation.
